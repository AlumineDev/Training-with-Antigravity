# --- ANTIGRAVITY ACADEMY: LESSON 1 ---
# Concept: Variables and Basic Math

# 1. Here are our variables (our "data containers")
gross_salary = 2500  # This is the total money before taxes
tax_percentage = 0.20 # This represents 20% tax

# 2. CHALLENGE: You need to calculate the tax amount and the final net salary.
# I've started the logic for you, but it's missing the math!

# Calculate how much money goes to taxes:
# (Hint: multiply gross_salary by tax_percentage)
tax_amount = gross_salary * tax_percentage

# Calculate the final salary after taxes:
# (Hint: subtract tax_amount from gross_salary)
net_salary = gross_salary - tax_amount # gross salary means total, 

# 3. This part prints the result to your screen
print(f"Gross Salary: ${gross_salary}")
print(f"Tax Deducted: ${tax_amount}")
print(f"Net Salary: ${net_salary}")

# MISSION: 
# Once you finish the math, save the file and tell me "I am ready!" 
# Then we will run it together to see if you passed the first test!
