# 🚀 Training with Antigravity

Welcome to my personal coding journey! This repository is not just a collection of code—it is a live record of my growth as a developer, powered by a unique partnership with **Antigravity**, my AI Teacher.

## 🍎 The Methodology: "AI as the Teacher"
Unlike standard AI-generated projects, this repo follows a strict **Pedagogical Framework**. We do not use "Copy-Paste" coding. Instead, we work through:

1.  **Direct Instruction**: My teacher explains the *Why* behind every concept (Variables, Loops, Logic).
2.  **Guided Practice**: I am given incomplete "Lesson" files where I must write the logic myself.
3.  **The "Antigravity" Exam**: At the end of each module, I pass a comprehensive graduation test that combines all previous skills.
4.  **Aesthetic Excellence**: Every project we build focuses on premium, high-end design and professional standards.

## 🛤️ Progress Tracker

### ✅ Phase 1: The Brain (Core Logic) - COMPLETED
> **Student Reflections on Phase 1:**
> *   **Variables & Lists**: "They are the base of programming. The options are infinite; you can store and take each value inside of them."
> *   **The For Loop**: "I see it like a small machine. You give it an order and it starts to run in circles. If you don't tell it to stop, it never stops!"
> *   **Functions**: "You write a lot of data and instructions, then you just call them. You can see the result of many operations at once without repeating yourself."

*   **Variables & Operators**: Calculating complex tax and salary logic.
*   **Lists & Collections**: Processing large payroll datasets.
*   **Control Flow (If/Else)**: Designing "smart" logic for bonuses and top earners.
*   **Functions**: Building reusable software engines.
*   **Automation**: Building a standalone Folder Scanner tool.

### 🏗️ Phase 2: Data & Assets - IN PROGRESS
*   **External Data**: Processing CSV and Excel files.
*   **Error Handling**: Making scripts robust for real-world messy data.
*   **GUI Development**: Turning scripts into professional desktop applications.

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a developer who believes in mastering the foundations. By using AI as a **Mentor** rather than a **Shadow writer**, I am building the intuition and skills needed to lead the next generation of software production.
